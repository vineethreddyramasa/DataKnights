## Organization

**Name**: San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory      
**Type**: Nonprofit Organization

**Mission Statement**

"_Our primary goal at CCFS is to study the seasonal and long-term population patterns of migratory, breeding, wintering, and resident species in order to provide scientific data to inform riparian management decisions, and for the general scientific community._"

**Stakeholders**

The internal stakeholders, which are mostly comprised of the executive team and the Board of Directors, are scientists and researchers that specialize in Biology, Ecology, and Environmental Studies.

The Executive Director for the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory is Dr. Yiwei Wang. Dr. Wang’s two biggest goals are finding ways to improve the coexistence between humans and animals, and how to make scientific data more available and useful to people outside the organization.

Primarily, our data visualizations will be used by specialists in the field to help develop insights and direct future research and analysis. The data visualizations need to be accurate and well-documented for a scientific audience, which should use a functional design that incorporates established best practices. Research from the field of information design will help us create effective visual communication for scientific data.

However, our team should also consider a broader audience, because the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory’s goals are more than simply having a better understanding of bird trends and patterns. The organization also wants to increase the awareness of its bird research to help improve understanding among people in the general population. By presenting this information to a broader audience, who will be potentially unfamiliar with the underlying data, we will have an additional emphasis on usability, clarity, and intuitiveness when designing our data visualizations.

**Data capabilities (maturity/literacy)**

Current data capabilities at the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory seem to be mixed. The data collection is a manual process and assisted by various volunteers and citizen scientists. The data sources appear to be mostly kept in Excel spreadsheets and the reporting is typically shared through static PDF files.

Our team considers the raw data skills for the researchers associated with this program to be at a high level, because they have domain knowledge and familiarity with the data collection process. It’s also likely they have experience with more data-intensive scientific research. However, based on the reports shared on the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory’s website, their data visualization capabilities are not sophisticated.

**Priorities**

The San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory is interested in how changes in the climate and human activity are affecting bird habitats, migration patterns, and general health. The organization studies reproductive patterns, social structure, and dispersal behavior. This research is helped by land managers, the community, and partnerships with various universities and bird conservatories.

Bird research can have many areas of focus, which may include the analysis of different patterns in migration, behavior, survival rate, population growth, and life span. In addition to this internal research, the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory would benefit from finding creative ways to better educate and increase awareness to the broader public on factors that impact the health and size of bird populations.
