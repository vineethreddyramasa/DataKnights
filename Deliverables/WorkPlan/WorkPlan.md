# _DataKnights Work Plan_

## _Research Questions_
1. How is bird banding data changing over time? (Changes in migration, breeding and molting indicators)
2. Does habitat type affect the frequency and diversity of birds being captured per trap hour?
3. Are the breeding and molting seasons changing?  
4. What factors might explain the increase or decrease in the guilds? (Food, Habitat, Weather, Climate)
5. How is guild abundance changing over time?
6. Has the age ratio and sex ratios for birds changed significantly, and does it have a trend?
7. Has the number of bird species seen each year been stable or trending in a certain direction?
8. What percentage of species/guilds do we see only one time vs. repeat captures?
9. Can the data for repeat captures (with known band id's) answer questions about longevity and survival?
11. How does bird sightings compare between banding records and eBird data for the same area?
12. Do noticeable seasonal trends exist for different species/guilds?

## _Stakeholder Questions_
1. Several major changes in data collection methods seemed to have occured with trap site/operations. Why did this happen in the late 1990's, and should we focus only on data between 2000 and 2016?
2. Records with the following row IDs appear to have data quality issues with weight: 198966, 16488, 9407, 153546, 251000, 190714, 62874, 144029, 190241, and 154599. Do the stakeholders have a preference on how to handle outliers or potential data quality issues?
3. Have there been any major changes to habitat in the last 20 years that won't show up in the data?
4. Should we exclude the following sites from our analysis: 9290U, 9385, 9515, 9590, 9800, 9835, 9890, 990, 9927, and TRAN?
